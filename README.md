# Spring Boot Rest API

This is a simple REST API project using Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on a user entity with the following fields:

- id
- name
- email
- phone

## How to run

To run this project, you need to have Java 8 or higher and MySQL installed on your machine. You also need to create a database named `springbootrestapi` and update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL username and password.

Then, you can clone this repository and run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd Spring_Boot_Rest_API
mvn clean install
java -jar target/spring-boot-rest-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Alternatively, you can import this project into your preferred IDE and run it from there.

## How to use

Once the application is running, you can use any REST client tool (such as Postman) to test the API endpoints. The base URL is `http://localhost:8080/api/users`.

The available endpoints are:

- `GET /api/users` : Get all users
- `GET /api/users/{id}` : Get user by id
- `POST /api/users` : Create a new user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` : Update an existing user by id
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` : Delete a user by id

The request and response body format is JSON. For example, to create a new user, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/users` with the following body:

```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
}
```

And you will get a response like this:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
